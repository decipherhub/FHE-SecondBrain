# Definition

A field $F$ is a set equipped with two binary operations, addition ($+$) and multiplication ($\times$), that satisfy the following axioms:

1. Additive Structure:
    - $(F, +)$ forms an [[Abelian Group]].
    - The additive identity is denoted as $0$

2. Multiplicative Structure:
    - $(F\{0\}, \times)$ forms an abelian group
    - The multiplicative identity is denoted as $1$
    - $1\neq 0$; the multiplicative identity ($1$) is not equal to the additive identity ($0$)

3. Distributive Law:
    - For all $a, b, c \in F: a \times (b + c) = (a \times b) + (a \times c)$

More precisely, a field is a [[Commutative Ring|commutative]] [[Division Ring|division]] ring. In other words, a field is a [[Commutative Ring]] with unity where every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse. A noncommutative division ring is called a "**strictly [[Division Ring|skew field]]**".

## Example
- The rational numbers ($\mathbb{Q}$)
- The real numbers ($\mathbb{R}$)
- The complex numbers ($\mathbb{C}$)
