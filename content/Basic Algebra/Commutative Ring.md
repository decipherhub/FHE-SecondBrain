# Definition

A ring in which the multiplication is commutative is a **commutative ring**. A ring with a multiplicative identity element is a **ring with unity;** the multiplicative identity element $1$ is called "**unity**".

In a ring with unity $1$ the distributive laws show that

$$(\underbrace{1 + 1 + \cdots + 1}_{n \text{ summands}})(\underbrace{1 + 1 + \cdots + 1}_{m \text{ summands}}) = (\underbrace{1 + 1 + \cdots + 1}_{nm \text{ summands}})$$

that is, ${(n\cdot 1)}{(m\cdot 1)} = {(nm)\cdot 1}$
