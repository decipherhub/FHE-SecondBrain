# Ethereum Cryptography

## Introduction

Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain platform that enables developers to build and deploy decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. It was proposed by Vitalik Buterin in 2013 and officially launched on July 30, 2015. Ethereum introduces programmability, enabling developers to create self-executing contracts and complex decentralized applications.
Ethereum relies on advanced cryptographic principles such as elliptic curve cryptography ([[ECC]]), cryptographic hash functions, and digital signatures to secure transactions, validate blocks, and enable smart contract execution.

In addition to its cryptographic foundations, Ethereum leverages innovative concepts like **Merkle Patricia Trees**, **Keccak-256**, and **[[Zero Knowledge Proofs]]** to support its decentralized architecture and extend its functionality beyond simple value transfers.

## Cryptographic Components in Ethereum

### 1. **[[Elliptic Curves]] Cryptography ([[ECC]])**

Ethereum uses the **secp256k1** elliptic curve for public and private key generation, the same as [[Bitcoin]]. This ensures secure, asymmetric encryption for Ethereum wallets and transactions.

#### How It Works:
- A **private key** is a randomly generated 256-bit number.
- The **public key** is derived using elliptic curve multiplication with a predefined generator point.

#### Applications in Ethereum:
- **Wallet Addresses**: Ethereum addresses are derived by hashing the public key with **Keccak-256** and taking the last 20 bytes.
- **Transaction Signing**: Private keys are used to sign transactions, ensuring authenticity and preventing tampering.

### 2. **[[Hash function]]s**

Ethereum uses **Keccak-256**, a variant of the [[SHA]]-3 family of cryptographic [[Hash function]]s, as its primary hashing algorithm.

#### Applications in Ethereum:
- **Transaction Hashes**: Every transaction is uniquely identified by its hash.
- **Merkle Patricia Trees**: Ethereum uses this data structure to efficiently store and verify account states, transactions, and receipts.
- **Mining**: In Ethereum 1.0, proof-of-work mining required finding a nonce such that the Keccak-256 hash of the block header met a difficulty target.

### 3. **[[Digital Signature]]s**

Ethereum employs the **Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm ([[ECDSA]])** for transaction validation.

#### How It Works:
1. A sender signs the transaction data with their private key.
2. The signature is verified by the network using the sender’s public key.

#### Features:
- **Authenticity**: Verifies that the transaction was created by the owner of the private key.
- **Integrity**: Ensures that transaction data hasn’t been altered after signing.
- **Non-repudiation**: The sender cannot deny signing the transaction.

#### Example:
When a user sends ETH or interacts with a smart contract, the transaction is signed with their private key. Nodes verify the signature before adding the transaction to a block.

### 4. **Merkle Patricia Trees**

Ethereum uses a variant of [[Merkle Tree]]s, known as **Merkle Patricia Trees**, to structure and verify blockchain data.

#### How It Works:
- Accounts, storage, and transactions are stored in trees.
- Each node in the tree contains a hash of its children, culminating in a single **root hash**.
- Verifiers can check the inclusion of data (like transactions) without downloading the entire tree.

#### Applications in Ethereum:
- **State Management**: Stores account balances, storage variables, and smart contract states.
- **Transaction Verification**: Enables efficient verification of transactions and receipts.
- **Proof-of-Inclusion**: Ensures that a specific piece of data exists in the blockchain without requiring the full dataset.

### 5. **Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and BLS Signatures**

With Ethereum’s transition to **Proof-of-Stake (PoS)** in Ethereum 2.0 (via the [Beacon Chain](https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/beacon-chain/)), cryptography plays an essential role in validator consensus.

#### Features of PoS Cryptography:
- **BLS Signatures**: Ethereum 2.0 uses **Boneh-Lynn-Shacham (BLS)** signatures to aggregate signatures from multiple validators into a single signature, reducing data size.
- **Security**: BLS signatures rely on the discrete logarithm problem in pairing-friendly elliptic curves.

#### Applications in Ethereum:
- **Validator Consensus**: Validators sign and propose blocks using BLS signatures.
- **Aggregation**: Efficiently aggregates multiple signatures, improving scalability and reducing network bandwidth.

## Advanced Cryptographic Techniques in Ethereum

### 1. ** (ZKPs)**

Ethereum supports **[[Zero Knowledge Proofs]]** through Layer 2 solutions and zk-rollups, enabling scalable and private transactions.

#### Features:
- **Privacy**: Verifies transactions without revealing underlying data.
- **Efficiency**: Reduces on-chain computation and storage.
- **Scalability**: Processes thousands of transactions off-chain and submits a single proof on-chain.

#### Applications:
- **[[ZK-SNARK]]s**: Used in privacy-preserving applications and scalability solutions.
- **zk-Rollups**: Batches transactions off-chain and verifies them on-chain with a single proof.

### 2. **Homomorphic Encryption**

Though not natively implemented in Ethereum, research into homomorphic encryption explores enabling computations on encrypted data without decrypting it, which could benefit private smart contracts. Check **[Zama](https://www.zama.ai/).**

## Implications of Ethereum Cryptography

### Strengths:
1. **Smart Contract Security**: Cryptography underpins the security of Ethereum’s programmable transactions.
2. **Scalability**: Advanced techniques like zk-rollups and BLS signatures enhance Ethereum's throughput.
3. **Decentralization**: Cryptographic protocols maintain the trustless nature of Ethereum.

### Limitations and Challenges:
1. **Quantum Threats**: As with [[Bitcoin]], Ethereum’s cryptographic algorithms could be vulnerable to future quantum computers.
2. **Complexity**: Advanced cryptographic techniques, such as [[ZK-SNARK]]s, require significant computational resources and expertise.

## Cryptographic Advancements in Ethereum

Ethereum continuously evolves its cryptographic foundations to enhance security, privacy, and scalability.

- Introduced a cryptographic structure for managing gas fees through the **BASEFEE** mechanism.

### 2. **Verifiable Random Function (VRF)**
- Used in Ethereum 2.0 to select block proposers randomly and fairly among validators.

### 3. **Quantum-Resistant Algorithms**
- Research is underway to explore lattice-based cryptography and other quantum-resistant methods for Ethereum’s future.
