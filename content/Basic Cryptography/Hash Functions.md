# Hash Functions

## Introduction

A **hash function** is a mathematical function that takes an input (or "message") and returns a fixed-size string of bytes, typically a digest that represents the original data. Hash functions are widely used in cryptography, data integrity verification, and efficient data retrieval.

A well-designed hash function exhibits key properties that make it useful for security applications, such as **irreversibility**, **uniqueness**, and **efficiency**.

## 1. Properties of a Cryptographic Hash Function

A strong cryptographic hash function should satisfy the following properties:

1. **Deterministic**  
   - The same input will always produce the same hash output.

2. **Preimage Resistance** *(One-way property)*  
   - Given a hash output, it is computationally infeasible to retrieve the original input.

3. **Second Preimage Resistance**  
   - Given an input and its hash, it is difficult to find a different input with the same hash.

4. **Collision Resistance**  
   - It is infeasible to find two different inputs that produce the same hash.

5. **Avalanche Effect**  
   - A small change in the input results in a drastically different hash output.

6. **Fast Computation**  
   - The function should be efficient and fast to compute.

## 2. Common Hash Functions

Several cryptographic hash functions are widely used today:

- **MD5 (Message Digest Algorithm 5)**  
  - Produces a 128-bit hash.  
  - Considered broken due to vulnerabilities in collision resistance.

- **[[SHA]]-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1)**  
  - Produces a 160-bit hash.  
  - No longer secure for cryptographic purposes due to successful collision attacks.

- **[[SHA]]-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2)**  
  - Includes SHA-256 (256-bit output) and SHA-512 (512-bit output).  
  - Stronger than SHA-1 and widely used in security applications.

- **SHA-3 (Keccak Algorithm)**  
  - Uses a different approach than SHA-2.  
  - More resistant to future attacks.

- **BLAKE2 and BLAKE3**  
  - Faster alternatives to SHA-2 with comparable security.

## 3. Applications of Hash Functions

### **1. Data Integrity & Verification**
- Used in checksums and digital signatures to verify the integrity of files.
- Example: Verifying software downloads by comparing hash values.

### **2. Cryptographic Security**
- **Password Hashing:**  
  - User passwords are stored as hashes (e.g., using bcrypt, Argon2).  
  - Prevents attackers from directly accessing plaintext passwords.

- **Digital Signatures:**  
  - Hashes ensure message integrity before signing with cryptographic keys.

### **3. Blockchain & Cryptocurrencies**
- **Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies** use **SHA-256** for:
  - Mining (Proof-of-Work).
  - Transaction verification.
  - Merkle Trees for efficient transaction validation.

### **4. Data Structures (Hash Tables)**
- Used for fast lookups in databases and programming languages.

## 4. Example: SHA-256 Hashing

Let's consider an example:

**Input:** `"Hello, World!"`  
**SHA-256 Hash Output:**  
```
a591a6d40bf420404a011733cfb7b190d62c65bf0bcda32b53b4c96fb20f96c8
```

Any slight change in the input, such as `"hello, world!"`, will result in a completely different hash.

## 5. Summary

- Hash functions are essential for security, data integrity, and cryptographic applications.
- Cryptographic hash functions should be **one-way, collision-resistant, and efficient**.
- Widely used hash functions include **[[SHA]]-256, SHA-3, and BLAKE2**.
- Applications range from **password security** to **[[blockchain]]** and **[[digital signature]]s**.

As cryptographic research advances, new hash functions are developed to resist emerging threats such as quantum computing.
