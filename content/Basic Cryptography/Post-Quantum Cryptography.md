# Post-Quantum Cryptography

## Definition

**Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)** refers to cryptographic algorithms designed to be secure against the potential threats posed by quantum computers. While classical computers operate on bits (0s and 1s), quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits, which can represent 0 and 1 simultaneously due to superposition. This capability allows quantum computers to solve certain mathematical problems exponentially faster than classical computers, rendering many of today's cryptographic algorithms vulnerable.

PQC aims to develop new cryptographic systems that can run on classical computers but are secure against both classical and quantum attacks. These algorithms are based on mathematical problems believed to be hard for quantum computers to solve efficiently.

## Quantum Computing and Cryptography

### Challenges with Current Cryptographic Algorithms

The public key cryptosystems currently in widespread use, such as [[RSA]], **Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)**, and [[Diffie-Hellman]] **key exchange**, rely on the computational difficulty of certain mathematical problems:

- **Integer Factorization**: The basis for [[RSA]] encryption.
- **Discrete Logarithm Problem**: Used in [[Diffie-Hellman]] and ECC.

Quantum computers threaten these systems because of algorithms like **Shor's algorithm**, which can solve these problems in polynomial time, effectively breaking the security of these cryptosystems.

#### Shor's Algorithm

- **Developed by**: Peter Shor in 1994.
- **Capability**: Efficiently factors large integers and computes discrete logarithms.
- **Impact**: Can break [[RSA]], ECC, and other cryptosystems relying on these hard problems.

#### Grover's Algorithm

- **Developed by**: Lov Grover in 1996.
- **Capability**: Provides a quadratic speedup for unstructured search problems.
- **Impact**: Affects symmetric-key algorithms like [[AES]] by effectively halving the key length (e.g., a 256-bit key would offer 128 bits of security against quantum attacks).

### Implications

- **Data Security**: Encrypted data intercepted today could be stored and decrypted in the future once quantum computers become powerful enoughâ€”a threat known as "store now, decrypt later."
- **Urgency for Transition**: There is a need to transition to quantum-resistant algorithms before large-scale quantum computers become operational.
